# getasound_test

This project is the Web test project for the getasound start-up.






Let's see what is on the Web page:

- bootstrap used
- differents buttons
- container for writing
- texts
- images in the buttons
- on the way the Web page is, it can be adapted to any devices







Let's see what is missing on the Web page:

- the texts in the firts buttons aren't well placed and not in 15px Normal
- the last buttons are too big
- they are in columns instead of lines and not hidden
- when we click on the firts buttons their border aren't blue
- the buttons for B2C are missing
- the differents titles aren't gray, and maybe too big again
- the container isn't enough big
- the number 123 isn't on the top-right of the container (so it's not decreasing)
